# TicketMaster Challenge Project

## Introduction
This project is a challenge submission for TicketMaster, showcasing a modern Android application built with Kotlin. It employs the MVVM architecture and utilizes several key technologies and libraries to create a robust and maintainable codebase. The application features a search tab that allows users to find events by name, demonstrating seamless integration of various components and libraries.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for events by name through an intuitive search interface.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Jetpack Compose, offering a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Data Persistence**: Local data storage using Room for a seamless offline experience.
- **Image Loading**: Utilizes Coil for efficient and easy image loading.
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin is used for dependency injection, simplifying the architecture and promoting modularity.
- **Networking**: Retrofit is used for network operations, making API calls straightforward and efficient.

## Technology Stack
- **Kotlin**: A modern programming language for Android development.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a clean separation of concerns and enhances maintainability.
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous and more efficient handling of tasks.
- **Room**: Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite for smoother database access.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native UIs.
- **Coil**: An image loading library for Android, supporting Kotlin Coroutines.
- **Koin**: A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android.
